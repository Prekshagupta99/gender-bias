# Reading for  Bias

We are updating our language because we are now working to include bias related to race and ethnicity. Some of the code/commands as well as the project title will still reflect the original project which focused on gender bias. The goal is to continue to update this tool as new ways of identifying ALL forms of bias are recognized.

***Promote equity by identifying potential bias in letters of recommendation and evaluations***

***Autocorrect for bias***
