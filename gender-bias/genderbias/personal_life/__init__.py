Check for statements that pertain to personal, rather than profession, life.

Letters for women are more likely to discuss personal life.

Goal: Develop code that can read text for terms related to personal life like
family, children, etc. If the text includes personal life details; return a
summary that directs the author to review the personal life details for
relevance and consider removing them if they are not relevant to the
recommendation or evaluation.
