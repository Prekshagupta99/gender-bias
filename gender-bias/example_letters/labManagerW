I am writing to recommend NAME for the position of lab manager. As is required for this position, she is diligent, hardworking, and meticulous. She is willing and able to learn new things quickly. While she is pleasant and considerate, she is also willing to act firmly to enforce necessary procedures for research with human subjects. She will not be afraid to challenge any hint of cutting corners. 

In conclusion, I recommend NAME without reservation. She will be a tremendous support to your lab's work.
